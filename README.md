Current plant disease analysis is slow, costly, and relies on experts, causing economic losses for farmers. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network-powered tool to improve accuracy and efficiency, enabling prompt action to reduce plant disease losses.

To determine the type of plant disease, a convolution neural network (CNN) is developed and a classifier is also built.

Using transfer learning with pre-trained Inception-V3 as a base, a CNN model is built and it's overall accuracy in classifying the kind of plant disease is 96.45%.

The suggested CNN was created from the ground up and has a 96.45% accuracy rate after 20 epochs. Other plant's disease classification can be done using the suggested CNN-based classification approach.
